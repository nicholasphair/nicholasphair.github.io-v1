Inspired by the traditions of DÃ­a de Muertos I wanted to honor those 
family and friends - furry and not - who are no longer with us. This page
serves as an altar so we may never forget them.

Oscar "Meyer" was my childhood dog. He was the Goldendoodle before it was
cool to be a goldendoodle. My family has many great memories with Oscar,
who was lovingly nicknamed The Devil Doodle by my uncle. I'll always 
remember him sitting underneath his favorite tree as we played out back,
surveying the driveway for any UPS driver who dared come too close. 
Not shockingly, while Oscar had a big bark, it was really a facade for a 
bundle of fur who loved having his paw held. Other great memories include Oscar eating
my grandma's birthday cake. Oscar hopping through snow, disappearing 
every time his feet hit the ground because his white fur blended in. His
insistence on tearing the wrapping paper off of gifts for us, and his love
for all food - cheese doodles and nilla wafers were among his favorites.
He is very missed.
