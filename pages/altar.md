Inspired by the traditions of DÃ­a de Muertos I wanted to honor those 
family and friends - furry and not - who are no longer with us. This page
serves as an altar so we may never forget them.

We adopted Luna our sophomore year of college. It was less of us choosing Luna
and more of Luna choosing us. Well, choosing my girlfriend, Anna, really. As the
story goes Anna put her hand in Luna's crate and she, a normally bashful
cat, rubbed up against it. She was the one. Luna went by many, many names. 
There was Luna, Miss Luna, Lunatic, Looney, Looney Tunes, Tooney, 
Tuna, Tuna Fish, Fish, Fishy, Fish Stick, Toothless (she looked like toothless 
the dragon), Big Momma, and probably many more.  

Luna was the definition of a therapy cat. She always knew when someone 
was sad and needed attention. We have so many great memories with Luna. 
There was her first (and only) time in the snow. Her love for Sheeba, 
particularly Sheeba sticks. How she would come alive at night and play 
with her favorite toys. She was quite fond of crinkle balls and an old 
yellow ball that predates her by years. In fact, it is only
with this yellow ball would we ever hear her little squeaks (she may 
have been mute). And of course, there was her patient, stalking of strings,
watching birds out the windows, basking in the sun, pawing us in bed for food, 
and being a great big sister to our other cat Millie. I could write pages
about the things we love about her. We love Luna and she is very missed.

# Oscar

Oscar "Mayer" was my childhood dog. He was the Goldendoodle before it was
cool to be a goldendoodle. My family has many great memories with Oscar,
who was lovingly nicknamed, "The Devil Doodle", by my uncle. I'll always 
remember him sitting underneath his favorite tree as we played out back,
surveying the driveway for any UPS driver who dared come too close. 
Not shockingly, while Oscar had a big bark, it was really a facade for a 
bundle of fur who loved having his paw held. Other great memories include Oscar eating
my grandma's birthday cake. Oscar hopping through snow, disappearing 
every time his feet hit the ground because his white fur blended in. His
insistence on tearing the wrapping paper off of gifts for us, and his love
for all food - cheese doodles and nilla wafers were among his favorites.
He is very loved and very missed.
