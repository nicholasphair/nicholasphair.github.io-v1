Welcome. I'm Nick and this is my site. I'm an undegrad at Virginia Tech (hence the site's color scheme)
majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. My tech interests lie all over the place. They
include, though definitely are not limited to, software design and all things programming,
computer architectures, operating systems, cyber security, hardware/electronics tinkering, and some networking.


I think its important to have interests all over the place. In that regard, I enjoy
all sorts of sports. Hockey, football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and boxing top my list.
I would also love to get into woodworking. My experience is limited to some crumby hand tools
and a jewlery box but I am actively stalking the forums and am looking forward to 
the day I can set up my own home shop. Lately, I've found myself drawn to American Literture.
I've been making my way through some of the classic short stories and am trying to memorize
a few poems. Like my tech interests though, this is not an exhaustive list.


As mentioned on my home page, I see this site as an opportunity to share what I know with
whoever wants to read. I am extremely passionate about teaching and love the idea of
using technology as a platform to do so. So much so that I wrote my college essay about
khanacademy founder Sal Khan. He is a tremendous inspiration to me and at somepoint I'd
like to start producing videos in a similar fashion.

Welcome, and thanks for reading!
