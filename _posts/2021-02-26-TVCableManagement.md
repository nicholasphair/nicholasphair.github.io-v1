I finally got around to cleaning up my wires.
<!--more-->  

There is something so satisfying about a tidy assortment of wires. Conversely,
nothing is more nauseating than than a messy web of wires. Bearing these 
feelings in mind, it was time to to tackle this embarrassment.

Armed with inspiration from [redit][1], I wrangled a disaster into a work of 
art attached to the back of our TV.

Okay, maybe not a work of art but, I am proud of it.  

A few details to share. First, I went with pegboard because I thought it would
make attaching my devices easier. While that was sometimes true, often the
mounting holes on the device did not line up with a hole one the board. I 
am really not too sure why I thought they would. I found myself drilling
new holes into the board to get spacing right. Nevertheless, if I was to do
this again I would stick with the pegboard. The reason is to maximize airflow. Second,
I used tiny plastic M5 bolts to connect the devices. I bought [this kit][2] on Amazon
and had plenty to mount my devices. Third, for devices without mounting holes
(eg. the gateway and xbox) I used Velcro. Fourth, all of my wires are held together
by Velcro. I prefer Velcro to zip-ties because Velcro better tolerates moving and removing.
Lastly, I made three service loops. The largest is the power and coax loop. Then there
is a loop for CAT5 cables, and a loop for HDMI cables. I wanted these loops separate
from the power as I suspect that they are the least likely to stay fixed.  

Thanks for reading!
