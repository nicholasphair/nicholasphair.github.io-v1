I am thrilled to announce that I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science in the Fall!
<!--more-->  

To my Hokie friends, forgive me, I am becoming a Wahoo. The opportunity to work with the faculty 
at UVa was far too great to pass up. While my 3 years as a Software Engineer at CCRi will be 
coming to an end, I am beyond excited for this next chapter. 

I suppose I'll have to change this site's color scheme.

Wish me luck!
