Version 2 of pretty-aws-navbar released. 
<!--more-->  

Recently, Amazon gave a facelift to the navigation bar of the AWS console. 
In response to this, I have released a new version of [pretty-aws-navbar][1].
On top of fixing the broken CSS, version 2 extends the prettification to
color the header, footer, dropdowns, search bar, and hover effects. Further,
version 2 now parses the html to find the region code rather than rely on
a hard-coded map.  

Deploy `pretty-aws-navbar` with a userscript manager like [greasemonkey][2] today!
